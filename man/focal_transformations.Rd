\title{Apply morphological transformations to identify connected outlier regions}
\usage{
focal_transformations(raster_object, min_cluster_size = 40)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster_object}{A raster object with binary values where 1 indicates
outlier spots and 0/NA indicates normal spots}

\item{min_cluster_size}{Numeric value specifying the minimum size for
isolated clusters. Clusters smaller than this threshold will be filled
(default: 40)}
}
\value{
A processed raster object with cleaned and connected outlier regions
}
\description{
Performs a series of focal operations to clean and connect outlier regions
in spatial transcriptomics data through morphological operations.
}
\details{
The function applies four sequential morphological operations:
\enumerate{
\item 3x3 fill: Fills spots completely surrounded by outliers
\item 5x5 outline: Fills spots outlined by outliers in larger window
\item Star pattern: Fills spots with outliers in cardinal directions
\item Small cluster removal: Removes isolated normal regions below threshold
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a raster from outlier data
r <- raster::rasterFromXYZ(outlier_coords)
# Apply morphological cleaning
r_cleaned <- focal_transformations(r, min_cluster_size = 30)
}

}
